            Covid-19 is terrible, but for me and my partner that recently became parents it was also
            a stroke of luck. Work shut down and home office was suddenly the new standard. I felt
            sincerely lucky to get to spend all my breaks, lunches and stretches with my partner and
            little baby girl.

                I had been saving for years. In Norway there is several steps for the bank to follow
                before giving a loan. One of those is that you need 15% of the loan amount yourself.

                Funny thing is I felt (and have later been told) that i tanked my interview. The
                first part of the interview was a classic talk that I felt went decent enough. The
                second part were a graphic code challenge that still makes me feel tense to this
                day. Somehow, I managed to snag the job.

                Throughout my first months at Digitroll I finally felt like I understood

                with one of the biggest fish and I got do delve into the deepest backend and the
                shiniest frontend. I was hooked.

                high school counselor prompted me to answer, &quot;I sit at my computer&quot;, and
                it made me realize that a degree in computer engineering was the way to go forward.

                A friend introduced me to Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, a game by Blizzard. The
                game was fun, but it was riddled with bots, and it didn&apos;t take long before I
                joined in and ran bots myself. The most common bots were written in Lua scripts, and
                you needed to tinker within the script files to make the bot work well. It sparked
                an interest.
