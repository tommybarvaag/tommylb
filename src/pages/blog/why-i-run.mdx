# Why I run?

## To challenge my body

Keep fit is one part of it.

## My health

As a developer I'm constantly bending over a PC screen. Running is my way of keeping my body
fit and ready for the next day. When I keep a good amount of traning output for several
weeks I start to notice improvements in my sleep, energy levels.

## Running is one of the few times that I really disconnect

Running as a therapeutic tool for disconnecting for the everlasting stream of push
notifications is undervalued.
