My professional career began in 2013 when I accepted a job offer from a small software company specializing in developing custom e-commerce solutions with a proprietary e-commerce engine. Fresh out of college, where I had studied computer science with a focus on DevOps, infrastructure, and SQL Servers, I can't exactly recall why I chose that particular job—perhaps it was the familiarity of starting alongside a former classmate. Nonetheless, in hindsight, I see it as the best decision I could have made. I learned tremendously during my tenure at that company—working with clients, managing my time efficiently, collaborating within a team, and last, but not least, sparked my passion for frontend development.

## 2017

In 2017, eager to further my professional development, I sought new opportunities. Having worked with the same technology stack for several years, I had a desire to broaden my horizons. I discovered a position at a larger company utilizing a more modern technology stack, incorporating React for the frontend and C# for the backend. Excited by the prospect of delving into these technologies, I eagerly embraced the opportunity.

Reflecting on my time at Knowit today brings a smile to my face. I've gained invaluable experience and had the privilege of collaborating with remarkable individuals. I've grown both personally and professionally, and I'm immensely grateful for the journey.

My passion for frontend development blossomed during my tenure at Knowit. I love working with React, crafting elegant and intuitive user interfaces. Engaged in stimulating projects and surrounded by incredibly talented peers, I take pride in my contributions and can't wait to build more exciting applications in the future.

## 2023

By 2023, working as a senior consultant with an impending contract conclusion amid a declining job market, I contemplated a slight career shift. After six years as a consultant, I aspired to develop something using my favorite technologies—to test things at scale, to build something that could potentially be used by thousands of people. I wanted to work on a product, not just a project.

In November 2023, a job posting caught my attention from Elmera Group ASA, a prominent electricity company seeking a senior software developer proficient in React, Next.js, and related technologies. Intrigued, I submitted my application.

Following a series of interviews and technical assessments, I felt optimistic about the company's vision and the challanges ahead. Extensive discussions with my potential team manager underscored the company's commitment to enhancing its digital presence to remain competitive. I felt exited by the prospect of contributing to such a large rewrite of current projects and joining a team passionate about innovation, I accepted the job offer after careful deliberation and family discussions, bidding farewell to my previous role just before the new year, eagerly anticipating a fresh start.

## 2024

On January 15, 2024, I started my journey with Elmera Group, welcomed by my new colleagues and guided through the office.

The past two months have been a whirlwind of new experiences and challenges, navigating a new domain while establishing a fresh codebase for the company's future frontend.

I'm thrilled to develop four cutting-edge frontend applications for the company, leveraging the latest technologies, including Next.js, React Server Components, React Aria, Tailwind, Truborepo, Docker, and more.

Let's ship.
