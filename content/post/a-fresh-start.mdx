My professional career startet back in 2013 when I accepted a job offer for a small software company that specialized in developing custom e-commerce solutions with a proprietary e-commerce engine. I was fresh out of college where I had studied computer science with a focus on DevOps, infrastructure, and SQL Servers. I can't really remember why — maybe it was the comfort of starting a job with a former classmate — but the job I accepted was as a junior developer with a focus on full-stack development creating websolutions for small to medium-sized businesses.

Looking back, the reasoning was unclear, but writing this today, I can see that it was the best decision I could have made. I learned so much during my time at that company. I learned how to work with clients, how to manage my time, how to work with a team, and how to write code that was maintainable and scalable.

## 2017

In 2017, I was eager to learn more and continue my professional development. I had been working with the same technology stack for a few years, and I wanted to expand my horizons. I started looking for new opportunities and found a job at a larger company that was working with a more modern technology stack. They were using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. I was excited to start working with these technologies and learn more about them.

Today I look back at my time at Knowit with a smile on my face. I've learned so much during my time here, and I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing people. I've grown both personally and professionally, and I'm grateful for the experiences I've had.

I found my passion for frontend development during my time at Knowit. I love working with React and building beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects and learn from some incredibly talented people. I'm proud of the work I've done here, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.

## 2023

Working as a senior consultant with a contract nearing it's end and a job market that was on a downward sprial, I started to entertain the idea of changing the direction a tiny bit. I had been working as a consultant for the past 6 years, and I wanted to build something working with my favorite technologies. I wanted to build a product that I could be proud of and that would make a difference. During november 2023 I noticed a job posting for a large electricity company called Elmera Group ASA. They were looking for a senior software developer with experience in React, Next.js and similar technologies. This peaked my interest, and I decided to apply for the job.

I went through a series of interviews and technical tests. The interview process was great, and I felt like I got a good sense of the company and the people working there. My potential team manager and i discussed at length the future of the company and the investment they wanted to make in the digital space. They acknowledged that they needed to invest to get their digital presence up to par with the competition. I was excited about the opportunity to work on such a project and to be a part of a team that was passionate about building great products.

I got the job offer, and after some careful consideration and discussions with my family, I decided to accept it. I handed in my resignation just before new years eve, excited to start a new chapter — a fresh start.

## 2024

My first day at Elmera Group was 15. january 2024. I was greeted by my new team and given a tour of the office.

The last two months have been a whirlwind of new experiences and challenges. Trying to learn a new domain while also setting up a whole new codebase for the future front-end of the company.

I'm excited to develop four first class front-end applications for the company. In my opinion using the latest and greatest technologies including Next.js, React Server Components, React Aria, Tailwind, Truborepo, Docker and more.
