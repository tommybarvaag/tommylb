Too often we see content that is written in a way that is not human. It's written in a way that is not natural. An example of this would be numbers from code pasted into paragraphs.

```ts
function VisualizeYear() {
  const year = 2;

  return <p>{`${year} year ago`}</p>; // 2 year ago
}
```

`2 year ago` is not a natural way to write a number. It should be `2 years ago`. And even better it could be `two years ago`.

How do we achive this?

## Pluralize

We have a function called `simplePluralize` that will pluralize a word based on a number. It will also handle "irregular words" with a optional third argument to account for words like `child` and `person`.

```ts
export const simplePluralize = (
  noun: string,
  count: number,
  options: {
    suffix?: string;
    pluralWord?: string;
  } = {
    suffix: "s",
    pluralWord: undefined
  }
) => {
  const pluralWord = options.pluralWord ?? `${noun}${options.suffix ?? "s"}`;
  return count === 1 ? noun : pluralWord;
};
```

Here we set the default suffix to `s`. This is because most words will just add an `s` to the end. But there are some words (as mentioned above) that will need to be handled differently. For example `child` will become `children` and `person` will become `people`. We can handle this by passing in the suffix as the third argument.

We can use this function like this:

```ts
const year = 2;

simplePluralize("year", years); // years

const months = 1;

simplePluralize("month", months); // month

const children = 2;

simplePluralize("child", children, { suffix: "ren" }); // children

const people = 2;

simplePluralize("person", people, { pluralWord: "people" }); // people
```

This is a good start, but we can do better.

## Humanize numbers

With the help of a utility function called `numberToWords` we can make our numbers more human.

```ts
const a = [
  "",
  "one",
  "two",
  "three",
  "four",
  "five",
  "six",
  "seven",
  "eight",
  "nine",
  "ten",
  "eleven",
  "twelve",
  "thirteen",
  "fourteen",
  "fifteen",
  "sixteen",
  "seventeen",
  "eighteen",
  "nineteen"
];

const b = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"];

const convertHundreds = (num: number) => {
  let result = "";

  if (num > 99) {
    result += a[Math.floor(num / 100)] + " hundred";
    num %= 100;
    if (num > 0) result += " ";
  }
  if (num > 19) {
    result += b[Math.floor(num / 10)];
    num %= 10;
    if (num > 0) result += " ";
  }
  if (num > 0) {
    result += a[num];
  }

  return result;
};

export const numberToWords = (input: string | number | undefined | null): string => {
  if (input === undefined || input === null || isNaN(Number(input))) {
    return "";
  }

  const number = typeof input === "string" ? Number(input) : input;
  if (number === 0) return "zero";

  if (number < 0 || number >= 1e12) {
    return number.toLocaleString();
  }

  let result = "";
  const billion = Math.floor(number / 1e9);
  const million = Math.floor((number % 1e9) / 1e6);
  const thousand = Math.floor((number % 1e6) / 1e3);
  const remainder = number % 1e3;

  if (billion > 0) result += convertHundreds(billion) + " billion ";
  if (million > 0) result += convertHundreds(million) + " million ";
  if (thousand > 0) result += convertHundreds(thousand) + " thousand ";
  if (remainder > 0) result += convertHundreds(remainder);

  return result.trim();
};
```

This function will convert a number to words. For example `2` will become `two` and `12` will become `twelve`. It can also handle big numbers like `1234567890` that will become `one billion two hundred thirty four million five hundred sixty seven thousand eight hundred ninety`. But humanizing big numbers might not be the best idea, but it can work marvels for smaller numbers.

We can use this function like this:

```ts
const year = 2;

`${numberToWords(year)} ${simplePluralize("year", year)}`; // two years
```

## Humanize dates

There are several good examples of how to humanize dates and we'll walk through two of them that I happen to use a lot.

### Duration

Let's say we want to show the duration from a date up until now with text. For example from `2021-01-01` to `2023-12-01` we want to show `2 years and 11 months`.

If you want to copy the `intervalToDuration` function you can find it at the bottom of this page.

```ts
export const getDurationAsYearsAndMonths = (startDate: Date, endDate: Date): string => {
  const { years, months } = intervalToDuration(startDate, endDate);

  if (years === 0 && months === 0) {
    return "less than a month";
  }

  if (years === 0) {
    return `${months} ${simplePluralize("month", months)}`;
  }

  if (months === 0) {
    return `${years} ${simplePluralize("year", years)}`;
  }

  return `${years} ${simplePluralize("year", years)} and ${months} ${simplePluralize(
    "month",
    months
  )}`;
};
```

This function will take two dates and return a string with the duration between them. It will return `less than a month` if the duration is less than a month. It will return `2 months` if the duration is 2 months. It will return `2 years and 11 months` if the duration is 2 years and 11 months.

On some scenarios this can be easier on the eyes than just outputting the duration in dates like `2021-01-01 â€” 2023-12-01`. On example of this is LinkedIn's experience section that [I shamelessly copied for my own CV](/cv/experience).

### Time ago

Let's say we want to show how long ago something happened. In this case we always want to show the greatest unit. This means if year is greater than 0 we only show years. If months is greater than 0 we only show months. And so on.

For example `2023-12-2` to `now` should show <TimeAgo />.

```tsx
export const getHumanizedDateFromNow = (date: Date) => {
  const now = new Date();

  const { days, hours, minutes, months, seconds, weeks, years } = intervalToDuration(date, now);

  if (years && years > 0) {
    return `${years} ${simplePluralize("year", hours)}`;
  }

  if (months && months > 0) {
    return `${months} ${simplePluralize("month", hours)}`;
  }

  if (weeks && weeks > 0) {
    return `${weeks} ${simplePluralize("week", hours)}`;
  }

  if (days && days > 0) {
    return `${days} ${simplePluralize("day", hours)}`;
  }

  if (hours && hours > 0) {
    return `${hours} ${simplePluralize("hour", hours)}`;
  }

  if (minutes && minutes > 0) {
    return `${minutes} ${simplePluralize("minute", minutes)}`;
  }

  if (seconds && seconds > 0) {
    return `${seconds} ${simplePluralize("second", seconds)}`;
  }

  return "now";
};
```

I use this function to show how long ago I wrote a post. For example `2 years ago` or `2 months ago`. But the use cases are endless.

One great way to incorporate humanized dates is to use it directly withing a paragraph like I do for my frontpage where I highlight how many years I've been working as a developer.

## Conclusion

Readable content is more important that you think, and small changes can make a big difference.
