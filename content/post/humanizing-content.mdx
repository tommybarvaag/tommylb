Too often we see content that is written in a way that is not human. It's written in a way that is not natural. An example of this would be numbers from code pasted into paragraphs. `2 year ago` is not a natural way to write a number. It should be `two years ago`. And even better it could be `two years ago`.

How do we achive this?

## Pluralize

We have a function called `simplePluralize` that will pluralize a word based on a number. It will also handle irregular words.

```ts
export const simplePluralize = (noun: string, count: number, suffix: string = "s") =>
  `${noun}${count !== 1 ? suffix : ""}`;
```

Here we set the default suffix to `s`. This is because most words will just add an `s` to the end. But there are some words that will need to be handled differently. For example `child` will become `children` and `person` will become `people`. We can handle this by passing in the suffix as the third argument.

We can use this function like this:

```ts
const year = 2;

simplePluralize("year", years); // years

const months = 1;

simplePluralize("month", months); // month
```
