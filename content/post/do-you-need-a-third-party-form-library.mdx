Consider the following form:

```jsx
<form>
  <input name="fullName" required />
  <input name="email" required />
  <textarea name="message" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Without taking any consideration to spam prevention, let's investigate how we can handle the form with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and a traditional approach using HTML5 validation.

<Callout type="warning">
  For this article, I will be using React Hook Form. If you are not familiar with React Hook Form, you can read more about it [here](https://react-hook-form.com/).

There are other form libraries out there such as [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react). I will not be covering those libraries in this article.

The spec for our form is as follows:

- Validate that the name is only letters and spaces
- Validate that the email is a valid email address

## React Hook Form

React Hook Form is a library that helps you build performant and flexible forms. It is a wrapper around the browser's native form validation. It is a light-weight library that is less than 10kb at the time of writing.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

const isOnlyLettersAndSpaces = value => /^[a-zA-Z ]+$/.test(value);

// Overly simplified email validation
const isValidEmailSimple = email => /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/.test(email);

function Form() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = data => console.log(data);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <label htmlFor="fullName">
        Full Name
        <input
          id="fullName"
          {...register("fullName", {
            required: true,
            validate: value => isOnlyLettersAndSpaces(value)
          })}
        />
        {errors?.fullName && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="email">
        Email
        <input
          id="email"
          {...register("email", { required: true, validate: value => isValidEmailSimple(value) })}
        />
        {errors?.email && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="message">
        Message
        <textarea id="message" {...register("message", { required: true })} />
        {errors?.message && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Easy enough, right? We register our fields with the `register` function and then we can use the `errors` object to display any errors. To further accommodate our spec, we can add a `validate` function to the `register` function. This function will be called when the form is submitted and will return a boolean value. If the value is `true`, the field is valid. If the value is `false`, the field is invalid.

Let's look at the same form using a basic HTML5 approach.

## HTML5

```jsx
function Form() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor="fullName">
        Full Name
        <input
          id="fullName"
          name="fullName"
          pattern="^[a-zA-Z ]+$"
          title="Only letters and spaces are allowed"
          required
        />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor="email">
        <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor="message">
        <textarea id="message" name="message" required />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

You could argue that this is easier on the eyes. We have to add a `pattern` attribute to the `fullName` field and a `type` attribute to the `email` field. We also must add a `title` attribute to the `fullName` field to provide a message to the user if the field is invalid.

## Posting the form

<Callout>
  I love working with Next.js and I highly recommend it. Most of my projects are built with it and
  naturally I will use it for examples on this site. If you are not familiar with Next.js, you can
  read more about it [here](https://nextjs.org/).

### React Hook Form post

Let's look at how we can post the form data with React Hook Form.

```jsx {16-29}
import React from "react";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

const isOnlyLettersAndSpaces = value => /^[a-zA-Z ]+$/.test(value);

// Overly simplified email validation
const isValidEmailSimple = email => /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/.test(email);

function Form() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = async data => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/contact", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });

    // check if the response is successful
    if (response.ok) {
      // do something
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <label htmlFor="fullName">
        Full Name
        <input
          id="fullName"
          {...register("fullName", {
            required: true,
            validate: value => isOnlyLettersAndSpaces(value)
          })}
        />
        {errors?.fullName && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="email">
        Email
        <input
          id="email"
          {...register("email", { required: true, validate: value => isValidEmailSimple(value) })}
        />
        {errors?.email && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="message">
        Message
        <textarea id="message" {...register("message", { required: true })} />
        {errors?.message && <span>This field is required</span>}
      </label>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

We can use the `onSubmit` function to post the form data to our endpoint. We can use the `fetch` API to post the data.

### HTML5 post

First, we need to add an `onSubmit` attribute to the form and then we can use the `fetch` API to post the data via the `submit` event.

```jsx {2-21,24}
function Form() {
  async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const response = await fetch("/api/contact", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: e.currentTarget?.fullName?.value,
        email: e.currentTarget?.email?.value,
        message: e.currentTarget?.message?.value
      })
    });

    // check if the response is successful
    if (response.ok) {
      // do something
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="fullName">
        Full Name
        <input
          id="fullName"
          name="fullName"
          pattern="^[a-zA-Z ]+$"
          title="Only letters and spaces are allowed"
          required
        />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor="email">
        <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor="message">
        <textarea id="message" name="message" required />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Both versions are similar. We can use the `fetch` API to post the data to our endpoint. The only major difference is that React Hook Form provides a `handleSubmit` function that automatically prevents the default form submission behavior and parses the form data into a JavaScript object.

## Conclusion

So, when should you use React Hook Form? I recommend using it for complex forms that require conditional validation, dynamic form fields, or asynchronous data fetching. If you have a lot of form fields or your form is nested, React Hook Form can help you manage your form state more efficiently.

In conclusion, while React Hook Form is a great library for managing forms in React, it may not be necessary for simple forms in a Next.js site. For simple forms, you can use React's built-in hooks and HTML5 form validation attributes to manage form state and perform basic validation. Save React Hook Form for complex forms, where its performance benefits and intuitive API shine.
