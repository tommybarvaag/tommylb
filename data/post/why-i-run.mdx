## To challenge my body

Keep fit is one part of it. I love achieving a goal such as running a new distance, setting a new personal best, or checking a race off my bucket list.

## My health

As a developer I'm constantly bending over a PC screen. Running is my way of keeping my body
fit and ready for the next day. When I keep a good amount of traning output for several
weeks I start to notice improvements in my sleep, energy levels and general mood.

## Running is one of the few times that I really disconnect

Running as a therapeutic tool for disconnecting for the everlasting stream of push
notifications is undervalued.
